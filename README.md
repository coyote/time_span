Time Span
==========

This gem is still in Alpha.  The API might well break between now and release, use at your risk.

Better documentation will also follow, as I learn how to write Yard docs.

A RelativeTime can occur with more than one TimeSpan, so must also keep track of the TimeLine to TimeSpan relationship.

For now I am focused on spec coverage and core code functionality.
